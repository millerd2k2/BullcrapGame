A little attempt at making an online version of the Bullsh*t (or Cheats) card game for me to learn the Blazor (C# and HTML) framework.

This will be developed in 3 stages:
- Game logic with 1 player controlling the entire board (completed)
- Reconfigure to a multiplayer game with multiple client connections
- Create a lobby system so multiple games can be hosted

Once this project picks up off the ground more, I will update this to help make the project more navigable.
